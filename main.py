Below there are different functions definitions, which have different purposes.
For a brief description read the following list:

Functions:
    - def print_pause(message):
        this function take one parameter(message)
        to print inside the other functions, and moreover,
        take care of the pausing.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def intro():
        this function is an introduciton to the game.
        It describes the first steps of the game,
        and thanks to the random.choice() function wrote above,
        it takes randomly one enemy,
        passing it inside the print_pause function.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def house():
        this function is called when the player choose to knock on the door.
        The player(you) approach the door and an enemy steps out to attack you.

                                        ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
                                        ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
                                        ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

        spoilerüòÅ: you only have a tiny digger,
        maybe is better if you choose to enter inside the cave...
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def cave():
        this function check if the weapon is inside the player's weapon list.
        If not, print different messages to the player and
        add the weapon inside the player's weapon list.
        However, if the weapon is inside the list,
        the function print few messages that describe an empty cave.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def field():
        this function print one message telling that you're in the field again
        Later you can choose again, between the door of the house or the cave.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def win():
        it is used to describe the context when the player win the game.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def lose():
        the lose function describe the context when the player lose the game.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -def fight():
        with this function, the player choose to fight the enemy or run away.
        If the player want to fight, there is a chance to win,
        but only if the weapon is inside the player's weapon listüòú
        Otherwise, if the weapon is not in the list, well...
        However, the player can choose to run away,
        and in this case the field and game functions are called.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def game_over():
        that's the end. You lost. But...you can play again!!
        This function is built for that reason.
        If you type "yes" you'll play again, otherwise, if you type "no",
        well thanks for playing!
        In addition it checks if the input is valid.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - def game():
        this function asks the player to choose between knock the door
        or enter inside the cave.
        Based on the player's choice,
        the function returns different scenarios.
        Also, this function checks the input validation.
